Before deploying to Gcloud you will need the following

- Tylenol (for your own sanity)
- A service account JSON (export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="KEY_PATH") for locally running the instance
- A running instance of Cloud SQL with instance name (found on the overview page of Cloud SQL)
- An artifact registry
- Cloud run enabled along with its 3 critical APIs (find link)
